## WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT

### Traditional Vendor vs. ZIMA Partnership

| Traditional Approach | ZIMA Partnership |
|---------------------|------------------|
| You pay 100% upfront | We share costs 50/50 |
| Vendor profits, you take risk | We share risk AND reward |
| Limited commitment post-delivery | We're invested in long-term success |
| You own, they disappear | Joint ownership, ongoing collaboration |
| Fixed scope, change = more cost | Flexible, evolving together |

- **Market Impact**: Reach thousands of users across Tanzania
