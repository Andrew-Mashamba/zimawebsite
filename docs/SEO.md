## 1. SEO Fundamentals

### 1.1 Google Search Essentials

The Google Search Essentials form the foundation for making web content eligible to appear and perform well in Google Search. They encompass three core areas:

#### Technical Requirements
What Google needs from web pages to display them in search results. Most sites pass these requirements without deliberate effort.

#### Spam Policies
Behaviors and tactics leading to lower rankings or omission from search results. Sites prioritizing quality content and user experience perform better.

#### Key Best Practices

1. **Create helpful, reliable, people-first content**
2. **Use searchable language** in prominent page locations (titles, headings, alt text, link text)
3. **Ensure links are crawlable** so Google discovers other site pages
4. **Promote your site** through relevant communities
5. **Follow specific best practices** for images, videos, structured data, and JavaScript
6. **Enable appropriate search appearance features** for your content type
7. **Control content visibility** using appropriate methods for exclusion

> **Important:** "It doesn't cost any money to appear in Google Search results, no matter what anyone tries to tell you."

---

### 1.2 How Google Search Works

Google Search operates through three sequential stages:

#### Stage 1: Crawling
Google downloads text, images, and videos from pages using automated programs called crawlers (Googlebot). These discover pages through:
- URL discovery
- Sitemap submissions
- Following links from known pages

#### Stage 2: Indexing
Google analyzes the text, images, and video files on the page and stores the information in the Google index. During this phase:
- Canonical versions of pages are identified
- Similar content is clustered together
- Signals about language, geographic relevance, and usability are collected

#### Stage 3: Serving Search Results
When users enter queries, Google searches its index for matching pages and returns results believed to be highest quality and most relevant. Relevancy depends on hundreds of factors including:
- Location
- Language
- Device type
- Query intent

> **Key Limitation:** Google doesn't guarantee crawling, indexing, or serving of any page, even when sites follow Search Essentials. Google also doesn't accept payment for higher rankings.

---

### 1.3 SEO Starter Guide

#### Help Google Find Your Content

**Check Current Indexing Status:**
Use the site search operator: `site:yourwebsite.com`

**Ensure Proper Rendering:**
Google should see pages the same way users do. Ensure CSS and JavaScript resources aren't blocked.

#### Site Organization

**Descriptive URLs:**
```
Good: https://www.example.com/pets/cats.html
Bad:  https://www.example.com/page?id=123
```

**Topic-Based Directory Structure:**
Group similar pages in directories to help Google understand content organization.

**Duplicate Content Management:**
- Not a spam violation but wastes crawling resources
- Each piece of content should be accessible through one URL
- Implement canonical tags or redirects for duplicates

#### Content Quality

High-quality content characteristics:
- Text is easy-to-read and well organized
- Content is unique (not copied from competitors)
- Content is up-to-date
- Content is helpful, reliable, and people-first

**Anticipate User Search Behavior:**
- Consider different search terms users might use
- Some users use technical terminology
- Others use conversational language

**Minimize Advertising Distractions:**
Avoid excessive ads or intrusive interstitials that obstruct content.

#### Link Best Practices

**Anchor Text Quality:**
Write descriptive anchor text explaining linked content.

**Link Trust:**
- Only link to trustworthy resources
- Use `nofollow` for links you cannot endorse
- User-generated content links should automatically receive `nofollow`

#### What Google Doesn't Use for Ranking

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Meta keywords | Not used |
| Keyword stuffing | Against spam policies |
| Domain keywords | Minimal impact |
| Specific content length | No magic word count |
| PageRank alone | Just one signal among many |
| E-E-A-T | Not a direct ranking factor |

---

### 1.4 Do You Need an SEO?

#### What SEOs Provide
- Review of site content or structure
- Technical development advice
- Content creation guidance
- Keyword research
- SEO training

#### Getting Started Independently
Small business owners can often handle SEO themselves. Results typically take **4 months to 1 year** from the time you begin making changes.

#### Red Flags to Avoid
- Claims of guaranteed #1 rankings
- Creating "shadow" domains with deceptive redirects
- Placing "doorway" pages loaded with keywords
- Involvement in link schemes or buying links
- Operating secretively or refusing transparency

> **Warning:** "You are responsible for the actions of any companies you hire."

---

## 2. Crawling and Indexing

### 2.1 Sitemaps

A sitemap is a file providing information about pages, videos, and files on a site, plus their relationships.

#### When Sitemaps Help Most
- **Large sites** - Comprehensive internal linking becomes difficult
- **New sites** - Minimal external links pointing to the site
- **Media-rich sites** - Substantial video, images, or news content

#### When Sitemaps May Be Unnecessary
- Small sites (approximately 500 pages or fewer)
- Sites with comprehensive internal linking
- Sites lacking significant media or news content

#### Sitemap Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| XML Sitemap | Main page listing |
| Image Sitemap | Image locations within pages |
| Video Sitemap | Runtime, rating, age-appropriateness |
| News Sitemap | Article titles and publication dates |

---

### 2.2 robots.txt

A robots.txt file tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site.

#### Key Limitations

| Limitation | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| Cannot prevent indexing | Use noindex meta tags instead |
| Not universally enforced | Malicious crawlers may ignore |
| URLs can still appear | If external sites link to blocked URLs |

#### Appropriate Use Cases
- Manage crawl traffic for server efficiency
- Block unimportant or duplicate pages
- Prevent media files from appearing in search results
- Block scripts/stylesheets if pages load without them

> **Critical Warning:** "Don't use a robots.txt file as a means to hide your web pages from Google Search results."

#### Basic Syntax
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /private/
Allow: /public/

Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemap.xml
```

---

### 2.3 Meta Tags and HTTP Headers

#### Robots Meta Tags

```html
<!-- Applies to all search engines -->
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">

<!-- Google-specific -->
<meta name="googlebot" content="index, follow">
```

#### Common Directive Values

| Directive | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| `index` | Allow indexing (default) |
| `noindex` | Prevent indexing |
| `follow` | Follow links (default) |
| `nofollow` | Don't follow links |
| `nosnippet` | No text snippet |
| `max-snippet:[n]` | Max snippet length |
| `noarchive` | No cached version |
| `noimageindex` | Don't index images |

#### HTTP Header Alternative
```
X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow
```

#### Other Supported Meta Tags

| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `description` | Page summaries for snippets |
| `viewport` | Mobile-friendly design indicator |
| `google-site-verification` | Search Console ownership |
| `notranslate` | Prevent translation offers |
| `rating` | Adult content labeling |

---

### 2.4 Canonicalization

Canonicalization helps Google understand which version of duplicate pages should appear in search results.

#### Methods (Ranked by Strength)

1. **Redirects** - Strongest signal
2. **rel="canonical"** - Strong signal
3. **Sitemap Inclusion** - Weaker signal

#### Implementation

**HTML Link Element:**
```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/preferred-url">
```

**HTTP Header:**
```
Link: <https://example.com/preferred-url>; rel="canonical"
```

#### Best Practices
- Use absolute paths, not relative
- Don't use robots.txt for canonicalization
- Prefer HTTPS over HTTP
- Link consistently to canonical URL throughout site
- Don't specify different canonicals using different techniques

---

### 2.5 Redirects

#### Redirect Types

| Type | Status Code | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Permanent | 301, 308 | URL permanently moved |
| Temporary | 302, 303, 307 | Short-term relocation |

#### Implementation Methods

**Server-Side (PHP) - Permanent:**
```php
header('HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently');
header('Location: https://www.example.com/newurl');
exit();
```

**Apache (.htaccess):**
```apache
Redirect permanent "/old" "https://example.com/new"

# With mod_rewrite
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule "^/service$" "/about/service" [R=301]
```

**NGINX:**
```nginx
location = /service {
  return 301 $scheme://example.com/about/service;
}
```

**Meta Refresh (Instant = Permanent):**
```html
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=https://example.com/new">
```

**JavaScript (Last Resort):**
```html
<script>
  window.location.href = "https://www.example.com/newlocation";
</script>
```

> **Warning:** "Rendering may fail for various reasons. This means that if you set a JavaScript redirect, Google might never see it."

---

### 2.6 JavaScript SEO

#### How Google Processes JavaScript

1. **Crawling** - Fetches URLs, parses HTML for links
2. **Rendering** - Pages queue for JavaScript execution via headless Chromium
3. **Indexing** - Rendered HTML gets indexed

#### Critical Best Practices

| Practice | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Use meaningful HTTP status codes | Helps Google understand page state |
| Implement History API | Fragment-based navigation isn't crawlable |
| Avoid soft 404 errors | Use proper 404 pages or noindex |
| Set canonical URLs in HTML | More reliable than JavaScript |
| Use content fingerprinting | Avoids stale cached resources |

#### Content Optimization
- Use unique `<title>` tags and meta descriptions
- Implement structured data with JSON-LD
- Test lazy-loaded images following Google's guidelines
- Support web components with proper slot usage

> **Recommendation:** "Server-side or pre-rendering is still a great idea" for performance and broader bot compatibility.

---

### 2.7 Asking Google to Recrawl

#### Methods

| Method | Use Case | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| URL Inspection Tool | Individual URLs | Quota limited |
| Sitemap Submission | Bulk URLs | Best for new sites |

#### Timeline
Crawling can take **a few days to a few weeks**.

#### Important Notes
- Requesting recrawl doesn't guarantee inclusion
- Multiple requests don't speed up crawling
- Monitor via Index Status report or URL Inspection tool

---

### 2.8 URL Structure Best Practices

#### Requirements for Crawlable URLs

**Valid URL Formats:**
- `https://example.com/products`
- `/products` (relative)
- `/products.php?id=123`

**Invalid URLs to Avoid:**
- `javascript:window.location.href='/products'`
- URL fragments for content changes (`#/products`)

#### URL Construction Guidelines

| Practice | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Use hyphens (`-`) | Separate words with hyphens, not underscores |
| Use descriptive words | Avoid long numeric IDs |
| Keep URLs short | Remove unnecessary parameters |
| Use consistent case | URLs are case-sensitive |
| Use UTF-8 encoding | Percent-encode non-ASCII characters |

#### Parameter Best Practices
- Use `=` for key-value pairs
- Use `&` to separate parameters
- Use `,` for multiple values under one key
- Remove session IDs, referral parameters

---

### 2.9 Crawlable Links

#### Required Format
Google requires `<a>` HTML elements with `href` attributes:

```html
<!-- Crawlable -->
<a href="https://example.com/page">Link Text</a>
<a href="/products/shoes">Shoes</a>

<!-- NOT Crawlable -->
<a routerLink="products">Link</a>
<span href="...">Link</span>
<a onclick="goto('url')">Link</a>
```

#### Anchor Text Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use descriptive text | "Click here" or "Read more" |
| Be concise and relevant | Keyword stuffing |
| Provide context | Empty link text |
| Space links with surrounding text | Chain multiple links together |

---

### 2.10 Link Attributes (rel values)

| Attribute | Purpose | Use Case |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| `rel="sponsored"` | Mark paid links | Advertisements, paid placements |
| `rel="ugc"` | User-generated content | Comments, forum posts |
| `rel="nofollow"` | Don't associate/follow | When other values don't apply |

**Multiple values:** `rel="ugc nofollow"` or `rel="ugc, nofollow"`

---

### 2.11 Googlebot and Crawling

#### Crawler Types
- **Googlebot Smartphone** - Simulates mobile users (primary for mobile-first indexing)
- **Googlebot Desktop** - Simulates desktop users

#### Crawl Frequency
- Most sites: once every few seconds on average
- First 15MB of HTML processed; CSS/JS fetched separately
- Operates in Pacific Time from US IPs

#### Verification
User-agents can be spoofed. Verify Googlebot via:
1. Reverse DNS lookup on source IP
2. Match against official Googlebot IP ranges

---

### 2.12 Crawl Budget Management

#### What Affects Crawl Budget

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Crawl Capacity** | Parallel connections, server response time |
| **Crawl Demand** | Perceived inventory, popularity, staleness |

#### Optimization Best Practices

| Practice | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Consolidate duplicates | Reduce crawling wasted on duplicate URLs |
| Use robots.txt | Block unnecessary URLs (more efficient than noindex) |
| Return 404/410 | For permanently removed pages |
| Eliminate soft 404s | Return proper error codes |
| Update sitemaps | Include accurate `<lastmod>` tags |
| Avoid redirect chains | Minimize hops in redirect sequences |
| Optimize page speed | Faster pages allow more content reading |

**Target Audience:** Large sites (1M+ pages) or medium sites (10K+ daily changes)

---

### 2.13 HTTP Status Codes

#### Success Codes (2xx)

| Code | Google's Behavior |
|------|-------------------|
| 200 | Content passed to processing (indexing not guaranteed) |
| 201, 202 | Temporary wait before processing |
| 204 | No content received or processed |

#### Redirect Codes (3xx)

| Code | Signal Strength | Use Case |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| 301 | Strong (permanent) | URL permanently moved |
| 302 | Weak (temporary) | Short-term redirect |
| 307 | Weak (temporary) | Preserves request method |
| 308 | Strong (permanent) | Preserves request method |

Google follows up to 10 redirect hops.

#### Client Errors (4xx)

| Code | Google's Behavior |
|------|-------------------|
| 400, 401, 403, 404, 410 | Content doesn't exist; previously indexed pages removed |
| 429 | Server overload signal; reduces crawl rate |

#### Server Errors (5xx)

| Code | Google's Behavior |
|------|-------------------|
| 500, 502, 503 | Temporary crawl slowdown; indexed URLs may eventually drop |

---

### 2.14 Mobile-First Indexing

Google primarily uses mobile version for indexing. Follow these best practices:

#### Content Parity
- Mobile and desktop must have equivalent primary content
- Use identical titles, meta descriptions, and headings
- Preserve structured data on mobile version

#### Technical Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Responsive design | Google's recommendation |
| Identical robots meta | Same tags on both versions |
| Don't lazy-load primary content | Avoid user-interaction requirements |
| High-quality images | Use supported formats, consistent URLs |
| Consistent video URLs | Same structured data on both versions |

#### Common Errors to Avoid
- Missing structured data on mobile
- `noindex` tags blocking mobile content
- Different status codes between versions
- Multiple desktop pages → single mobile page

---

### 2.15 Blocking Indexing (noindex)

#### Implementation Methods

**Meta Tag (All Search Engines):**
```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex">
```

**Meta Tag (Google Only):**
```html
<meta name="googlebot" content="noindex">
```

**HTTP Header (Non-HTML Files):**
```
X-Robots-Tag: noindex
```

#### Critical Requirements
- Page must be crawlable (not blocked by robots.txt)
- Use URL Inspection tool to verify
- For urgent removal, use Search Console's removal tool

---

### 2.16 Removing Content from Google

#### Removal Methods

| Method | Speed | Duration | Security |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| Search Console Removals tool | ~1 day | ~6 months | Temporary |
| Delete content | Varies | Permanent | Most secure |
| Password protection | Varies | Permanent | Blocks all access |
| noindex tag | Varies | Permanent | Google only |

**Do NOT rely on robots.txt** for content removal.

---

### 2.17 Faceted Navigation

#### Preventing Unnecessary Crawling

| Method | Details |
|--------|---------|
| robots.txt Disallow | Block filtered URLs from crawling |
| URL fragments | Use `#filter=value` (Google ignores fragments) |
| rel="canonical" | Point filtered pages to unfiltered versions |
| rel="nofollow" | Add to all links to filtered pages |

#### If Faceted URLs Need Indexing

| Practice | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Use standard separators | `&` between parameters |
| Consistent filter ordering | Logical, predictable sequences |
| Return 404 for empty results | Proper status codes for no-match filters |
| Manage resources | Faceted navigation consumes significant crawl budget |

---

### 2.18 Site Moves with URL Changes

#### Key Steps

1. **Prepare new site** - Set up CMS, transfer content, configure robots.txt
2. **Create URL mapping** - Document old → new URL correspondence
3. **Implement redirects** - Server-side 301/308; avoid chains > 3-5 hops
4. **Submit Change of Address** - Use Search Console (except HTTP→HTTPS)
5. **Monitor traffic** - Track performance via Search Console

#### Timeline
- Medium sites: few weeks for most pages
- Keep redirects active: generally 1+ year

#### Best Practices
- Move one element at a time
- Schedule during low-traffic periods
- Update sitemaps with new URLs
- Ensure adequate server capacity

---

### 2.19 Valid Page Metadata

#### Valid `<head>` Elements
- `title`, `meta`, `link`, `script`, `style`, `base`, `noscript`, `template`

#### Invalid Elements
- `iframe`, `img`

> **Critical:** "If you use an invalid element in the `<head>` element, Google ignores any elements that appear after the invalid element."

---

### 2.20 Indexable File Types

#### Documents
PDF, DOC/DOCX, XLS/XLSX, PPT/PPTX, ODT/ODS/ODP, EPUB, RTF, CSV, XML, TeX

#### Media
- **Images:** BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, WebP, SVG, AVIF
- **Video:** MP4, WebM, AVI, MOV, MKV, MPEG, and many more

#### Source Code
Text files including C/C++, Java, Python, Perl, Basic

Use `filetype:` operator to search specific formats.

---

### 2.21 Sitemap Detailed Guidelines

#### Size Limits
- **Maximum:** 50MB (uncompressed) or 50,000 URLs per sitemap
- **Sitemap Index:** Up to 50,000 sitemap references

#### Format Requirements
- UTF-8 encoding mandatory
- Use fully-qualified, absolute URLs
- Google ignores `<priority>` and `<changefreq>` values
- `<lastmod>` should reflect significant content updates

#### Submission Methods
1. Search Console Sitemaps report
2. Search Console API
3. robots.txt: `Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemap.xml`
4. WebSub for Atom/RSS feeds

#### Video Sitemap Required Tags

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `<video:thumbnail_loc>` | Thumbnail image URL |
| `<video:title>` | Must match displayed title |
| `<video:description>` | Max 2048 characters |
| `<video:content_loc>` OR `<video:player_loc>` | Video file or player URL |

---

### 2.22 robots.txt Detailed Guidelines

#### Primary Purpose
Manage crawler traffic, NOT prevent indexing.

#### Syntax

```
User-agent: Googlebot
Disallow: /admin/
Allow: /admin/public/

User-agent: *
Disallow: /private/

Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemap.xml
```

#### What robots.txt Controls

| Content Type | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| Web pages | Manage traffic; URLs may still appear in results |
| Media files | Prevent appearing in search results |
| Resource files | Block if pages function without them |

#### Better Alternatives for Privacy
- Password protection
- noindex meta tags
- Complete content removal

---

### 2.23 Robots Meta Tag Detailed Reference

#### Indexing Rules

| Rule | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `all` | Default; no restrictions |
| `noindex` | Don't show in search results |
| `nofollow` | Don't follow links on page |
| `none` | Equivalent to `noindex, nofollow` |
| `nosnippet` | No text snippet or video preview |
| `noimageindex` | Don't index images on page |
| `notranslate` | Don't offer translation |

#### Snippet Controls

| Rule | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `max-snippet:[n]` | Limit text snippet to n characters |
| `max-image-preview:[size]` | none, standard, or large |
| `max-video-preview:[n]` | Limit video preview to n seconds |
| `unavailable_after:[date]` | Remove after specified date |

#### data-nosnippet Attribute

```html
<p>Visible <span data-nosnippet>hidden from snippet</span> visible</p>
```

**Note:** Don't add/remove via JavaScript; apply when creating elements.

---

## 3. Search Appearance

### 3.1 Visual Elements Gallery

Google Search results contain various visual elements:

#### Primary Result Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Text Result** | Based on textual content of the page |
| **Rich Result** | Uses structured data for graphical/interactive display |
| **Image Result** | Based on embedded images |
| **Video Result** | Based on embedded videos |
| **Exploration Features** | Help searchers expand and refine queries |

#### Attribution Elements
- Favicon
- Site name
- Visible URL
- Domain
- Breadcrumb

#### Text Result Child Elements
- Title link
- Snippet
- Byline date
- Sitelinks (group and individual)
- Text result image
- Rich attributes (review stars, etc.)

---

### 3.2 Title Links

The title link is the clickable heading in Google Search results.

#### Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Every page has a `<title>` element | Vague titles like "Home" |
| Descriptive, concise text | Unnecessarily lengthy titles |
| Unique titles for each page | Duplicate titles across pages |
| Brand name at start or end | Keyword stuffing |
| Match page's primary language | Different language than content |

#### Sources Google Uses for Titles
- `<title>` element content
- Main visual page titles
- Heading elements (`<h1>`, etc.)
- `og:title` meta tags
- Large, styled text
- Anchor text from links
- WebSite structured data

#### Common Issues Google Corrects
- Half-empty titles lacking main content
- Outdated information (old dates)
- Inaccurate descriptions
- Micro-boilerplate repetition
- Multiple prominent headings without clear hierarchy
- Language mismatches

---

### 3.3 Snippets and Meta Descriptions

A snippet is the description part of a search result.

#### How Snippets Are Generated
- Primarily from page content
- Meta description used if it better describes the page
- Different queries may show different snippets

#### Controlling Snippets

```html
<!-- No snippet -->
<meta name="robots" content="nosnippet">

<!-- Max length -->
<meta name="robots" content="max-snippet:150">

<!-- Block specific sections -->
<span data-nosnippet>This text won't appear in snippets</span>
```

#### Meta Description Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Unique description per page | Same description on every page |
| Include relevant information | Generic keyword strings |
| Generate programmatically for large sites | Keyword-only descriptions |
| Quality over quantity | Repetitive, unhelpful text |

**Good Example:**
> "Get everything you need to sew your next garment. Open Monday-Friday 8-5pm, located in the Fashion District."

---

### 3.4 Featured Snippets

Featured snippets are special boxes that display the descriptive snippet before the title link.

#### Key Points
- **Cannot be directly marked** - Google systems automatically select suitable pages
- Can appear independently or within "People Also Ask" sections
- Clicking takes users directly to the relevant page section

#### Opting Out

| Method | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `nosnippet` | Blocks both featured and regular snippets |
| `max-snippet:[n]` | Limits snippet length (lower values reduce featured snippet likelihood) |
| `data-nosnippet` | Excludes specific text sections |

---

### 3.5 Sitelinks

Sitelinks are links from the same domain clustered under a text result, helping users navigate to relevant sections.

#### How Google Generates Them
- Automatically analyzes site link structure
- Only shown when useful to users
- Site architecture must support identifying shortcuts

#### Optimization Best Practices

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|

### 3.10 Structured Data Overview

Structured data is standardized markup that explicitly labels page content to help search engines understand meaning.

#### Benefits

| Company | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Rotten Tomatoes | 25% higher click-through rates |
| Food Network | 35% increase in visits |
| Nestlé | 82% higher CTR for rich results |

#### Supported Formats

| Format | Description | Recommendation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **JSON-LD** | JavaScript in `<script>` tags | Recommended - easiest to maintain |
| **Microdata** | HTML5 tag attributes | Supported |
| **RDFa** | HTML5 extension attributes | Supported |

#### How Google Uses Structured Data

- Understand page meaning and context
- Display enhanced search results (rich results)
- Enable specialized search features
- Gather information about entities

#### Implementation Best Practices

| Practice | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Validate | Use Rich Results Test during development |
| Be Accurate | Provide complete, accurate data |
| Keep Visible | Only markup content visible to users |
| Follow Guidelines | Use Google Search Central docs over schema.org |
| Measure | Compare Search Console metrics before/after |

#### Generate Structured Data with JavaScript

For JavaScript-heavy sites, structured data can be injected dynamically:

```javascript
// Create and inject JSON-LD
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.type = 'application/ld+json';
script.text = JSON.stringify({
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Product",
  "name": "Product Name",
  "description": "Product description"
});
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

**Key Points:**
- Google renders JavaScript before indexing
- JSON-LD can be dynamically generated
- Test with Rich Results Test (include rendered HTML)
- Ensure data is available after JavaScript execution

### 3.13 Core Web Vitals

Core Web Vitals measure real-world user experience across loading, interactivity, and visual stability.

#### The Three Metrics

| Metric | Measures | Good Threshold |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | Loading performance | < 2.5 seconds |
| **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint) | Responsiveness | < 200 milliseconds |
| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) | Visual stability | < 0.1 |

#### LCP Optimization
- Preload critical resources
- Optimize images
- Reduce server response time
- Use efficient caching

#### INP Optimization
- Reduce JavaScript execution time
- Break up long tasks
- Optimize event handlers
- Use passive event listeners

#### CLS Optimization
- Set dimensions for images/videos
- Reserve space for dynamic content
- Avoid inserting content above existing content
- Use `transform` for animations

### 3.14 Google Discover

Google Discover is an interest-based feed showing content related to users' interests based on their Web and App Activity.

#### Eligibility Requirements

Content qualifies for Discover when:
1. The page is indexed by Google
2. It complies with Discover's content policies

No special tags or structured data are mandatory.

#### Optimization Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Craft titles reflecting content essence | Use sensationalism or clickbait |
| Feature high-quality images (min 1200px wide) | Mislead with preview details |
| Provide timely, story-driven content | Exploit morbid curiosity or outrage |
| Create helpful, people-first content | Withhold crucial context |

#### Content Types Featured

Discover showcases articles and videos across:
- Sports
- Health
- Entertainment
- Lifestyle

**Filtered Content:**
- Job applications
- Petitions and forms
- Code repositories

### 3.15 AI Features

#### AI Overviews

AI Overviews help users quickly grasp complicated topics and provide links for further exploration. They appear when Google determines they add value beyond traditional results.

#### AI Mode

Assists with queries requiring exploration, reasoning, or complex comparisons, allowing nuanced questions in a single search.

#### How Content Appears

Both features use "query fan-out" technique—issuing multiple related searches across subtopics. This displays a wider and more diverse set of helpful links, creating opportunities for new websites.

#### Optimization

According to Google: "There are no additional requirements to appear in AI Overviews or AI Mode, nor other special optimizations necessary."

**Standard SEO fundamentals apply:**
- Ensure crawling is allowed in robots.txt
- Provide quality internal linking
- Deliver strong page experience
- Present important content as readable text
- Support content with high-quality images/videos
- Match structured data to visible text
- Maintain current Business Profile and Merchant Center information

#### Controls

Manage content inclusion using existing controls:

| Control | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `nosnippet` | Exclude from AI features |
| `data-nosnippet` | Exclude specific sections |
| `max-snippet` | Limit snippet length |
| `noindex` | Prevent indexing entirely |
| `Google-Extended` | Block broader AI training |

### 3.17 Publication Dates

#### What Byline Dates Are

A byline date represents when Google estimates a page was published or updated. When determinable, it displays alongside the title and snippet.

#### Implementation Requirements

**1. User-Visible Date**

Display a prominent, clearly labeled date:
- "Posted Feb 4, 2019"
- "Published February 4, 2019"
- "Last updated: Feb 14, 2018"

**2. Structured Data**

Use `CreativeWork` subtypes with date properties:

<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "Article Title",
  "datePublished": "2024-01-15T08:00:00+00:00",
  "dateModified": "2024-01-16T10:30:00+00:00"
}
</script>
```

#### Date Format Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Date | Mandatory |
| Time | Optional |
| Timezone | Recommended for precision |
| Format | ISO 8601 in structured data |

#### Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Ensure visible and structured dates match | Use future dates |
| Include timezone information | Use event dates unrelated to publication |
| Account for daylight saving time | Display multiple confusing dates |
| Use ISO 8601 format in markup | Mismatch visible vs. structured dates |

> **Note:** Google doesn't guarantee byline dates will display, but following guidelines improves detection likelihood.

### 3.20 Flexible Sampling (Paywalls)

Flexible sampling refers to strategies for limiting access to paywalled content while maintaining search visibility.

#### Two Primary Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Metering** | Users receive quota of free articles monthly before paywall |
| **Lead-in** | Display article opening sentences above paywall |

#### Optimal Amounts

For daily news publishers: **6-10 articles per user per month**

Start with 10 articles and iterate from there.

#### Key Caution

User satisfaction degrades when paywalls appear beyond 10% of visits.

#### Implementation

Enclose paywalled content with structured data to distinguish legitimate paywalls from cloaking:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "NewsArticle",
  "isAccessibleForFree": false,
  "hasPart": {
    "@type": "WebPageElement",
    "isAccessibleForFree": false,
    "cssSelector": ".paywall"
  }
}
</script>
```
